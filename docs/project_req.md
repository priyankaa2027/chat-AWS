The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the Serverless Chat Application.

| Requirement ID | Description                  | User Story                                                                                       | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | User Registration             | As a user, I want to be able to create an account so I can start chatting.                        | The system should provide a registration form where users can sign up using email/password or social login (e.g., Google).          |
| FR002          | User Login                    | As a user, I want to log in to my account so that my identity is verified before chatting.         | The system should authenticate users via AWS Cognito and redirect them to the chat interface upon successful login.                |
| FR003          | Sending a Message             | As a user, I want to send a message to the chat so I can communicate with others in real-time.     | The system should allow users to input a message and broadcast it instantly to other connected users using WebSocket APIs.         |
| FR004          | Receiving Messages in Real-Time| As a user, I want to receive new messages from others without refreshing the page.                 | The frontend should listen to WebSocket events and update the chat view immediately when a new message is received.                 |
| FR005          | Chat History                  | As a user, I want to view the past conversation when I join the chat so I can catch up.             | When a user connects, the system should fetch the latest messages from DynamoDB and display them in the chat window.                |
| FR006          | User Presence Status          | As a user, I want to see who is online or offline so that I know who I can chat with.               | The system should track user connections through WebSocket connection IDs and update the user list accordingly.                    |
| FR007          | Message Persistence           | As a system, I need to store chat messages persistently so users can access previous conversations.| Every sent message should be stored in DynamoDB with a timestamp, sender ID, and message content.                                  |
| FR008          | Secure Messaging              | As a user, I want to be assured that my messages are securely transmitted and stored.              | The system should use secure WebSocket (wss://) connections and encrypt data at rest in DynamoDB.                                  |
| FR009          | Auto-Disconnect Inactivity    | As a system, I want to disconnect idle users to maintain system efficiency.                        | Users should be disconnected automatically after a period of inactivity (e.g., 10 minutes).                                         |
| FR010          | User Logout                   | As a user, I want to log out of the chat securely when I am done.                                  | The system should end the WebSocket connection and clear user session data when the user logs out.                                 |
| FR011          | Error Handling and Alerts     | As a user, I want to be notified if a message fails to send or if I lose connection.                | The frontend should show appropriate error alerts (e.g., "Message failed to send" or "Reconnecting...").                           |
| FR012          | Responsive UI                 | As a user, I want the chat app to work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.                 | The UI should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes seamlessly.                                                        |
